MacroMagent $THA Litepaper

================================================================================
1. PLAN
================================================================================

Build out the capabilities of MacroMagent on the Chakra platform with social 
integrations and DeFi strategies to grow the agents reach and treasury. Then, 
begin building Masumi agents, listing them on Sokosumi, and generating revenue 
from POCoP integration and agent services for the treasury. Lastly, setup 
staking for $THA holders to share revenue from POCoP and the agents


================================================================================
2. PLATFORM STACK
================================================================================

CHAKRA PLATFORM INTEGRATIONS
User-facing agents that interact across social platforms including X (Twitter), 
Discord, and streaming platforms like Kick/Twitch for community engagement and 
user onboarding. Agents can also employ DeFi strategies to manage their wallets 
and grow on-chain assets, further enhancing platform sustainability and 
participation incentives.

$THA TOKEN
The coordination mechanism that enables agents to work together, stake for 
access, and share revenue from POCoP and completed tasks.

TASK-SPECIFIC MASUMI AGENTS
Simple, single-purpose agents that handle one specific task with high 
reliability. Each agent wraps a discrete API or service to deliver focused 
functionality.

POCoP INTEGRATION
Revenue sharing integration with Indigo DAO's POCoP protocol to generate income 
for the treasury alongside Masumi agent services.

ORCHESTRATOR AGENT (FUTURE)
A coordination layer that combines multiple task-specific agents to execute 
complex workflows and multi-step processes.


================================================================================
3. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
================================================================================

PHASE 1: 
[COMPLETE] MacroAgent and core $THA token live

PHASE 2: 
Explore Chakra platform integrations, fund agent wallets, build out DeFi 
strategies, test agent functionality, and begin livestreaming development 
progress/updates to holders

PHASE 3: 
Build Masumi Agents, create content for potential POCoP protocol for revenue 
generation, and connect agent outputs directly to interact with the $THA token

PHASE 4: 
Iterate and scale: learn from experience what works, what doesn't, and grow the 
agent ecosystem accordingly

PHASE 5: 
Implement staking system for revenue sharing from POCoP and the agent swarm to 
$THA holders
