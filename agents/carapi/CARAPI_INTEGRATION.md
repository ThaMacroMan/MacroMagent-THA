# CarAPI Integration Summary

## Overview

Your CrewAI agent has been successfully integrated with CarAPI, enabling it to research and provide detailed information about vehicles, including makes, models, trims, and engine specifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `carapi_client.py`

A comprehensive CarAPI client that handles:

- JWT token authentication with CarAPI
- Automatic token caching and renewal
- Generic request method for API calls
- Specialized methods for:
  - `search_models()` - Search car models by make/year
  - `search_makes()` - Get all car makes
  - `search_trims()` - Search specific trims/configurations
  - `get_engines()` - Get engine specifications

**Key Features:**

- Token expires in 7 days and is automatically renewed
- Includes 60-second buffer for clock drift
- Proper error handling and logging
- Global singleton pattern for efficient resource usage

#### `crew_tools.py`

CrewAI tools that wrap the CarAPI client:

1. **CarMakeSearchTool** - Search for car makes/brands
2. **CarModelSearchTool** - Search for car models with filters
3. **CarTrimSearchTool** - Search for specific trim levels and configurations
4. **CarEngineSearchTool** - Get detailed engine specifications

Each tool includes:

- Input validation via Pydantic models
- Formatted output for readability
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Modified Files

#### `crew_definition.py`

- Added a specialized **Car Research Specialist** agent
- The agent has access to all 4 CarAPI tools
- Updated crew to include 3 agents:
  1. Car Research Specialist (with CarAPI tools)
  2. Research Analyst (general research)
  3. Content Summarizer (creates final summary)
- Enhanced task descriptions to guide agents on when to use CarAPI tools

#### `main.py`

- Updated input schema description to mention car/vehicle research capabilities
- Added better placeholder text for users

#### `requirements.txt`

- Added `crewai-tools` dependency (required for custom tool creation)

## Environment Configuration

Your `.env` file already contains the CarAPI credentials:

```bash
CAR_API_TOKEN=284a553c-b32a-4f6f-abfe-06ec84c2624e
CAR_API_SECRET=48571e6676e93a8b23107bc5a7d8e4a5
```

## How It Works

1. **JWT Authentication**: On first request, the agent authenticates with CarAPI using your API token and secret to obtain a JWT token
2. **Token Caching**: The JWT is cached in memory and reused for all subsequent requests
3. **Automatic Renewal**: When the token expires (after 7 days), a new one is automatically requested
4. **Agent Tools**: The Car Research Specialist agent can use any of the 4 tools to query vehicle data
5. **Context-Aware**: The agent intelligently decides when to use CarAPI tools based on the user's query

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Car Makes

User query: "What car brands are available?"

- Agent uses `search_car_makes` tool
- Returns list of all available manufacturers

### Example 2: Search Specific Models

User query: "Find all 2020 Ford trucks"

- Agent uses `search_car_models` tool with filters
- Returns matching models with details

### Example 3: Get Trim Details

User query: "Tell me about 2020 Ford F-150 trims"

- Agent uses `search_car_trims` tool
- Returns comprehensive trim configurations

### Example 4: Engine Specifications

User query: "What engines are available for 2020 Ford F-150?"

- Agent uses `search_car_engines` tool
- Returns detailed engine specifications

## Testing

### Quick Test (Recommended)

1. **Setup environment**:

```bash
cd agents/crewai-masumi-quickstart-template
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the test script**:

```bash
python test_agent.py
```

Or with a custom query:

```bash
python test_agent.py "Find all 2020 Tesla Model S trims"
```

This will:

- Test the CarAPI integration
- Show you exactly what the agent does
- Run without payment system
- Display the full result

3. **Test via API** (requires payment service):
   Start the API server:

```bash
python main.py api
```

Then query the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/start_job" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifier_from_purchaser": "test123",
    "input_data": {"text": "Compare 2020 Ford F-150 trims"}
  }'
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Why This Approach?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Client logic separate from tools
2. **Token Management**: Automatic caching prevents excessive API calls
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new CarAPI endpoints
4. **Error Resilience**: Proper error handling at each layer
5. **Professional Tools**: Uses industry-standard Pydantic for validation

### Security Notes

- JWT tokens are kept in memory only (never persisted)
- Tokens automatically expire and renew
- No sensitive data is logged
- Credentials stay in environment variables

### Performance Considerations

- Token caching reduces authentication overhead
- Tools use async/await for non-blocking operations
- Results are formatted efficiently for token usage

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: Follow the setup instructions in README.md
2. **Test with sample queries**: Try various car research queries
3. **Monitor API usage**: CarAPI has rate limits, monitor your usage
4. **Deploy**: Deploy your agent to Masumi network following the README

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'"

- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "CarAPI credentials not found in environment"

- Ensure `.env` file exists and contains `CAR_API_TOKEN` and `CAR_API_SECRET`

### "Failed to get JWT token"

- Verify your API credentials are correct
- Check your network connection
- Ensure you're on a paid subscription (free tier has limited access)

### Agent doesn't use CarAPI tools

- Make sure the query is about cars/vehicles
- Check that CrewAI is properly configured
- Review logs for any errors
